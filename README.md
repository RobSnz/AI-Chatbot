AI Helpdesk Chatbot
-------------------

The AI Helpdesk Chatbot was a full year, group assignment for our Research and Development paper. We worked closely with Westbourne Global IT as our client to deliver them the product they requested.

We were selected to undertake the AI Helpdesk project for Westbourne IT Global Services. They are a transglobal organization, currently with delivery centres in Cork, Auckland, and Foster City. They stand out from other companies due to their ability to deliver scalable and world class 24/7 technical help desks to their clients. The purpose of this project was to build and deploy the AI Helpdesk to act as a Tier 0.5 Support team, in the form of an AI Chatbot, for answering basic IT queries, such as email and password resets, settings, etc. For the long term significance of the company, this would allow the current Tier One teamâ€™s time to be freed up to focus on more complex tasks, thus allowing Westbourne IT to be more efficient and productive with their human resources.

The goals of the project were straightforward. We were to design and animate a 3D Avatar, which was to be as life-like as possible. This was stressed by the client, and he pointed out that this would be what would make this chatbot stand out from the rest, therefore it was the number one priority going into the development stage. This avatar was also meant to be gender-neutral, and we took it upon ourselves after consulting the client, to allow the user to have the option of using the male or female version of our designed avatar. In addition to this, the method of input had to be via keyboard and via voice recognition. This would allow more usability and extend to those users who may not be comfortable typing or talking. This chatbot should also follow the best practices of ITIL.

Overall, we recieved an A grade for the project.
